# Spain Electricity Shortfall Case Study: Predicting Daily Shortfall With Machine Learning (AI)

## Context 
The Spanish Government is considering further investments in renewable energy. To do so, they need information about Spain's current renewable and non-renewable energy generation trends and patterns. Specifically, they want to be able to predict the load shortfall on any given day given certain conditions (wind speed, pressure, humidity etc.). Load shortfall is the difference between renewable and non-renewable energy generation.
